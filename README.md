# ChronicNeuropixels
Neuropixels AMIE implant for chronic recordings in freely moving mice (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/05/406074)

The Neuropixel Casing (NPC) allows for chronic implantation of Neuropixels probes and recordings in freely moving mice.
There are three parts to the designL the internal mount, the external casing, and a stereotax adapter. All files are designed
in Solidworks. STL files are included for 3D printing. 

3D Printing
The internal mount (IM) and external casing (EC) can be printed at Shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/

Machining
The stereotax adapter (SA) is machined from alumnium. We recommend machining the SA through protolabs: https://www.protolabs.com/
