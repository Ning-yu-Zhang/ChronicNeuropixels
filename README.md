The Neuropixel AMIE allows for chronic implantation and re-use of Neuropixels probes and recordings in freely moving mice.
There are three parts to the design: the internal mount, the external casing, and a stereotax adapter. All files are designed
in Solidworks (https://www.solidworks.com/). STL files are included for 3D printing. 

3D Printing
The internal mount (IM) and external casing (EC) can be printed at Shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/. We printed and tested in VeroWhite material using a Stratasys Eden 260VS PolyJet 3D Printer with 16 Âµm resolution.

* Note: For Neuropixels 1.0 probes, use the "im_neuropixel 1_0" file for the IM. This has not been tested with the metal cap version, but is fit to the PCB board of this probe release.

Machining
The stereotax adapter (SA) is machined from alumnium. We recommend machining the SA through protolabs: https://www.protolabs.com/
